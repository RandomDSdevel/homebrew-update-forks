# Homebrew 'Update-Forks'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small utility project implements an external sub-command named 'update-forks' for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the missing package manager for macOS.  It's used to synchronize your personal forks of [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) and your installed Homebrew taps.  This is especially useful when you're staging (and about to submit) a pull request upstream.  

## Installation Instructions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just run:  

```
brew tap RandomDSdevel/homebrew-update-forks
```

and you'll be good to go!
